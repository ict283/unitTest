/* Test File */

/*
   This test file follows (loosely) the Test-Driven Development (TDD) paradigm for unit testing.
   Many testing paradigms exist. What you choose depends on your testing requirements (don't limit yourself).

   Simple TDD unit testing guidelines:
   - Write tests before writing the business logic
   - Each method tests only a single piece of logic
   - Each test has a condition that will certainly fail
   - Run all tests, see what fails
   - Refactor code, run all tests, see what fails
   - If a new test is added, run all tests, see what fails
   - You get the idea...
